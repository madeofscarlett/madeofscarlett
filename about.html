    <h1 style="color:#ed6ded; background-color:#e68bbe; font-family:foolish; font-size:96px;">About Me!</h1>

    <p style="background-color:#f4b8da; color:white; font-size:28px; width:80%; padding: 28px;">
    Scarlett was born in 2003, in a little coastal town called Whitehaven. Since then, she has been everyone's problem.
    <br><br>
    Growing up, she learned small amounts of a number of instruments: the venerable piano; the operatic vocal; the lightning-tinged guitar; and, mightiest of all, the noble descant recorder.
    <br><br>
    After deciding that the life of a programmer was not for her (a lesson that, judging by this site, she is still yet to fully learn), Scarlett took up Music Production in college, learning to work in Logic Pro X, as well as completing personal projects in Cakewalk and, later, moving to primarily working in Ableton Live.
    <br><br>
    After a messy, COVID-tinged college experience, Scarlett tried, once again, to go into computer engineering. Why she did this, we may never know.
    <br><br>
    Now, she studies Music Production once again, with an emphasis on soundtracks for games, podcasts, and other media. She posts her work regularly to her <a href="youtube.com/@scarlettscented/" style="color:white;">YouTube channel</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ptkQfjP52jOGGjXDHv2GG?si=A1KayHMHTFyxiLMTaQJTyA" style="color:white;">Spotify</a>.
    <br><br>
    When she is not working on music, Scarlett enjoys taking walks, playing Dungeons & Dragons with her friends, and procrasinating finishing Twin Peaks.
    <br><br>
    As of October 2023, she <i>has</i>, in fact, finished Twin Peaks. She <b>will</b> speak at length about it to anyone willing to listen. This is a threat.
