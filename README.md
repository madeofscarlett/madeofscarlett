### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Scarlett/Cas.
I'm mostly a musician, I don't really dabble in code all that much. That being said, I'd love to learn DSP; I've done tiny bits of PureData at university, as well as dabbling in C languages, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, and more.
I'm currently learning how to use github pages to host a simple lil' website. Any help is appreciated (unless I get the website working, in which case I am as unto a god). 

Pronouns: she/her
